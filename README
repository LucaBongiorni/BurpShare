THIS PROJECT IS IN ALPHA TESTING AND NOT READY FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION

Setup instructions:
0. Compile ShareHttpRequestResponse.java into a class file
1. Install Jython
2. Ensure Burp is setup to handle python extensions with Jython
3. Add the directory where the class file from above is located as the module path
4. Load BurpShare.py as an extension

Notes:
- Only tested on Burp 1.5.05 and 1.5.07, on Windows and Ubuntu
- It's not peer-to-peer. Connect to someone to send to them, and vice-versa.
- The XOR crypto key is hardcoded, which is terrible.
