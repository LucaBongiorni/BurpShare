THIS PROJECT IS IN ALPHA TESTING AND NOT READY FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION

Setup instructions:
0. Compile ShareHttpRequestResponse.java into a class file
1. Install Jython
2. Ensure Burp is setup to handle python extensions with Jython
3. Set the Burp Extension module folder to the BurpShare project folder
4. Load BurpShare.py as an extension

Notes:
- Only tested on Burp 1.5.07, on Windows and Ubuntu
- The XOR crypto key is hardcoded, which is terrible.
